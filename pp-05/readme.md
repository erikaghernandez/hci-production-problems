## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1.Reasonable load time: If the site takes too long to load people will might as well leave. To help
  aid this write semantic HTML, not incorporate CSS within HTML, and load JS at the bottom of HTML.
2.Navigation: Labels should be clear, links easily identifiable, as to minimize the number of clicks
3.Content Styling: Being consistent in styling, headings are clear, the body is styled in a manner that is readable
4.Contact/Feedback: Allow users to reach out and contact if necessary. Ultimately, it adds to the
  user experience because if they see a contact/feedback area then they are more likely to click
  and provide feedback
5.Concise and Explanatory: Content is easy to understand and organized. The content can be justified and is relevant.
