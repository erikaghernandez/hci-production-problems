## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=12D0u0ksrs8g1DMlRuzucl6COeg
Your Rationale: Green is a cool color that can represent new beginnings and
                seems appropriate for a new console.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=52f0u0kuTI+h9QIo4M9GmuTFWm3
Your Rationale: Looking at these colors screams spring. They are bright and colorful
                mimicking the colorful flowers that bloom in the spring.  

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=35u0S0kV-ZWstZYBf+bYYGyWHte
Your Rationale: This blue is friendly and energizing,the yellow is cheerful
                and gender neutral while the red is the accent color.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:https://paletton.com/#uid=23w0S0kiCFn8GVde7NVmtwSqXtg
Your Rationale: Overall the color blue can be used to express responsibility
                and being a cybersecurity professional requires this. Orange is
                not at vibrant as red but it can still symbolize importance.
